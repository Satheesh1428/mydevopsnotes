Ansible practical with ubuntu:
================================
Step1:
Create 2 EC2 instances one is Ansible-server and another one is target server
Note: Number of instance minimum is 2 and maximum can be more and naming for servers is our wish

Step2:
Install Ansible in Ansible server EC2 
sudo apt update 
sudo apt install ansible
ansible --version

Step3:
Making password less autentication between Ansible-server EC2 and target server EC2.
Login into Ansible-server EC2 and execute ssh-keygen 
public key is now created at location /home/ubuntu/.ssh/
         ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-42:~$ ls /home/ubuntu/.ssh/
         authorized_keys  id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub  known_hosts
Take below key 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-18-42:~$ cat /home/ubuntu/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

Login into target server EC2 now  and execute ssh-keygen 
ubuntu@ip-172-31-27-31:~$ ls ~/.ssh/
authorized_keys  id_ed25519  id_ed25519.pub
ubuntu@ip-172-31-27-31:~$ vim ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
