     npm can manage dependencies.
     npm can (in one command line) install all the dependencies of a project.
     Dependencies are also defined in package.json.

Sheell script:
==================
Step1 : if you want to right shell script you need a file 
Step2 : Create a file with extension with .sh , ex: satheesh.sh 
Step3: first syntax for any shell scripting is  shebang (#!/)
              #!/bin/bash
                          /dash
                          /sh
                          /ksh
Bash,dash,sh,ksh are executables
#!/bin/bash  and #!/bin/sh  both are same in couple of years back since even if we use #!/bin/sh  in back end it will direct to default shebang is #!/bin/bash  by using soft link 
But now they are different since some linux vendors are made default she bang as #!/bin/dash

sh <filename.sh>  or  ./ <filename.sh>   --- to execute a script file 
before executing we need to give permissions to files
